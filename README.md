Program Information
Allows you to protect your map from hacking.

If you uncheck "Protect RustEditData (IO/Loot/NPCs/Paths)," electrical components will not be loaded through the plugin.

If you uncheck "Protect Deployables, Spawners, Entities," entity prefabs will not be loaded through the plugin.

If you uncheck "Protect Against Editors/Servers," prefab categories will not be altered.

If you uncheck "Upload Map in Rust Hosting," the map will not be automatically uploaded to Rust hosting. Instead, you will receive the MapProtection.cs plugin and your map file separately.

In the "Entity Spam" checkbox, you can choose how many junk prefabs to add to the map.

Security Features
The protection blocks access through all known public hacking tools.

Neither Unity nor any other software can be used to hack the map.

Map Structure
The map is divided into front and back.

Back â€” the plugin that needs to be added to the "plugins" folder.
